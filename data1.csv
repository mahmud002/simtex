Americans, as opposed to the FCC, should be free to use whichever services we choose. Obama's power grab to regulate the Internet is a corruption of net neutrality. It stopped a light-touch system that worked very, very well for two decades with both parties' backing."
1,"To the Federal Communications Commission:  I have thoughts on net neutrality rules. I want to request the government to undo Obama's plan to control Internet access. People like me, not the FCC, should use whatever services we choose. Obama's plan to control Internet access is a corruption of net neutrality. It disrupted a light-touch approach that worked remarkably well for two decades with nearly universal backing."
2,"Mr Pai:  I would like to comment on network neutrality regulations. I would like to urge the commissioners to rescind Tom Wheeler's plan to take over Internet access. Americans, rather than big government, deserve to purchase the products they choose. Tom Wheeler's plan to take over Internet access is a exploitation  of the open Internet. It broke a hands-off framework that worked supremely well for decades with broad bipartisan consensus."

7,"Dear Commissioners:  I'd like to share my thoughts on Internet freedom. I strongly encourage the commissioners to repeal The Obama/Wheeler order to regulate Internet access.

9,"We need the FCC to defend the rights of millions of Internet users by upholding net neutrality protections. 

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai’s proposal to hand the ISP monopolies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon the legal cover to engage in data discrimination, stripping users of the meaningful access and privacy safeguards we demanded and just recently won. 

I’m worried about creating a tiered Internet with “fast lanes” for certain sites or services because ISPs could have too much power to determine what I can do online. Thankfully, the current FCC regulations ensure that ISP monopolies can’t block or slow our access to certain websites or engage in data discrimination by charging online services and websites money to reach people faster. That’s the best way forward to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits Internet users and small businesses as well as entrenched Internet companies. Pai’s proposed repeal of the rules would help turn ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That’s contrary to the basic precepts on which the Internet was built. 

Thank you for keeping Title II net neutrality rules in place to protect Internet users like me."

28,"Net neutrality is fundamental and should be preserved. I vote that the FCC leave net neutrality in place, no matter how much Donnie Trump wants to eliminate it. His newly appointed FCC Chairman will do anything his master wants, of course, but the rest of the commissioners can and should take the high road on this question. Thanks for considering this comment."
29,I entirely oppose this proposal to reverse net neutrality protections.   It is in the public interest for the Internet to be a level playing field for all; and large service providers already have sufficiently unfair advantages.   Retain and ENFORCE the existing consumer protections provided by Title II!
30,"Not only do we need to put a stop to these attempts to change net Neutrality, added fee's slow downs, ect, we need to make this a Constitutional Amendment."

33,"Please do not disrupt the current net neutrality rules, title 2 is the correct designation."
34,"Title II classification remains preferable to Net Neutrality being unenforceable under Title I. Before seeking to reclassify again, amend as necessary to allow for Net Neutrality to be enforced under Title I, and get those rules passed. What you're doing now is asking the public to jump off a cliff and trust you'll be able to work out the landing after."
35,PRESERVE NET NEUTRALITY AND TITLE II!!!  THE FCC SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWING ISP'S TO REGULATE WEB TRAFFIC ON THEIR OWN ACCORD!!!

Chairman Pai has made clear that he intends to do exactly this.

But if some companies can pay our ISPs to have their content load faster, startups and small businesses that can't pay those fees won't be able to compete. You will kill the open marketplace that has enabled millions of small businesses and created the 5 most valuable companies in America-just to further enrich a few much less valuable cable giants famous for sky-high prices and abysmal customer service.

Internet providers will be able to impose a private tax on every sector of the American economy.

Moreover, under Chairman Pai's plan, ISPs will be able to make it more difficult to access political speech that they don't like. They'll be able to charge fees for website delivery that would make it harder for blogs, nonprofits, artists, and others who can't pay up to have their voices heard.

I'm sending this to the FCC's open proceeding, but I worry that Chairman Pai, a former Verizon lawyer, has made his plans and will ignore me and millions of other Americans.

So I'm also sending this to my members of Congress. Please publicly support the FCC's existing net neutrality rules based on Title II, and denounce Chairman Pai's plans. Do whatever you can to dissuade him.

Thank you!

51,"The FCC's Open Internet Rules (net neutrality rules) are extremely important to me. I urge you to protect them.

I don't want ISPs to have the power to block websites, slow them down, give some sites an advantage over others, or split the Internet into ""fast lanes"" for companies that pay and ""slow lanes"" for the rest.

Now is not the time to let giant ISPs censor what we see and do online.

Censorship by ISPs is a serious problem. Comcast has throttled Netflix, AT&T blocked FaceTime, Time Warner Cable throttled the popular game League of Legends, and Verizon admitted it will introduce fast lanes for sites that pay-and slow lanes for everyone else-if the FCC lifts the rules. This hurts consumers and businesses large and small.

Courts have made clear that if the FCC ends Title II classification, the FCC must let ISPs offer ""fast lanes"" to websites for a fee.
